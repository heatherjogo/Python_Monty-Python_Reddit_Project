I am making a trading website as a demo, and I want to create a model for every trade, which includes ticker, name, price bought at etc, the problem is I can't understand what to use to get an uneditable decimal field, as in when I use an integer field the admin can edit that I want it to old value and not be editable.

8,kk2c6s,Python,Spotify Playlist Automatic Generator,"I've posted about this a while ago, but since significant changes were made, I felt like posting the updated version. 

I've developed a system that creates new playlists in spotify by grabbing all songs by artists in a list, either from a source playlist or from the artists in the path of related artists between to input artists provided by the user (this is new development). 

Next step is clustering these songs according to spotify metadata, for which I currently use Sklearn's agglomerative clustering. After the data is clustered, a Neural Network learns the clusters, and the songs are divided according to the cluster as predicted by the Neural Network. In each data cluster, the data is now reordered according to the shortest path between all points, as provided by a heuristic TSP solver (also new development). The reordered track lists are then truncated to a maximum duration, and provided back to the spotify API to create the new playlists.

The source code is hosted in github, in this link:[https://github.com/Jalabhar/Autoplaylist](https://github.com/Jalabhar/Autoplaylist)

Dependencies are: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras, Sklearn, NetworkX, Spotipy

A Spotify API client id and client secret are required for this code to run.

I had some free time so I created a benchmark of Python JSON packages.  
Multiple blog posts are discussing Python JSON serializing and deserializing performance but they are always correct only for the time they were posted.

I wanted to have a single, updating place for all programmers that need to decide what package to use when they start a new project and performance is a consideration.

TL;DR: [https://jsonperf.com](https://jsonperf.com)

Currently, JSONPerf supports Python 3 and Python 2.   
Additional languages will be supported in the future.

Another useful feature - you can benchmark using your JSON file.   
If most of the JSONs you deal with are in a certain structure, use that feature as it will tell you how different packages deal with your structure of JSONs!

Let me begin with a disclaimer: **The tool I'm going to present isn't a replacement of frontend expertise** and it's mostly suitable for full-stack developers. Therefore, I hope to get to full-stack developers who need to get their hands dirty (sorry frontenders, for backenders FE is a jungle) with frontend to manage/visualise data; things like admin dashboards, CRMs etc.

I've been developing my own dev tool to make frontend simpler for people like me who usually work on data management web apps. And they are similar/generic and at the same time custom and crafted to their use-cases. Their specificity provides a better UX and can't be achieved using low-code platforms. On the other hand, there are plenty of repeatable UI/logic pieces which could be given out-of-the box. Yes, there are frameworks and UI libraries but although they are flexible, they cannot compete with the simplicity of low-code platforms. Also, frankly speaking, drawing UI with libraries solves rather trivial problem when compared to dealing with connecting UI to the app, designing data flow etc. Therefore, an idea came to my mind; why not make a low-code(ish) tool which makes it faster that requires less tech knowledge whilst keeping it flexible. Obviously, my approach to tackle the problem is different. Instead of going all over drag &amp; drop, you can code using basics (as when frontend used to be just about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and underneath all the complex stuff is just happening for you. You code in a setup free online code editor with live preview. You are guided by live notifications which suggest what action needs to be implemented next. Then, you can download scalable code which meets the newest web standards (React-like but not precisely) and either keep tinkering with it or build it with Webpack. In the end you'll receive production-optimised code that delivers excellent page-load time.

The project's niche is admin dashboards but transforming Porto template which we used for our website was also a pleasure (we are a team of just two so don't be too judgemental about it). By transforming I mean making it reactive, light, prerender on server-side etc. basically making it production-ready. Here is our website: [https://www.glue.codes](https://www.glue.codes)

The ""complex"" parts you cannot or it’s harder to get with frameworks are:

* Setup-free coding environment with live preview which let’s you code with the newest version of JS.
* You begin with a template full of examples.
* It’s a self-contained tool which doesn’t require any other libraries, yet you can use any NPM frontend modules if you need to.
* Splitting UI into manageable pieces (in GlueCodes you just add two HTML attributes to generate slot with CSS stylesheet scoped to it).
* You type HTML which internally gets converted to code that uses Virtual DOM.
* There is a built-in app state flow management which lets you keep event handlers and data providers as functions. There is a single state which can be accessed from any place in the UI and event-handling/data-providing actions write to it by simply returning/resolving. Underneath, the result of any action it stored against the keys named after its name. So, in your UI you have access to two global variables `actions` (an object holding event handlers/actions) and `actionResults` (results of these actions). After executing an action, the entire UI is re-rendered, and you have access to its result. It’s just simple and it means that to code any logic, you just export out functions. It’s all glued for you.
* After downloading code, you can bundle it with a single command which uses Webpack. The result is static HTML files (prerenders) which are populated by Virtual DOM-based function in runtime. So, you don’t need server-side solution like Next.js and can deploy your site e.g. to AWS S3 which is cheap.
* There are widgets you can insert in your HTML with a single-click. And it might be not so existing especially with simple presenters. However, more complex widgets are installed with their required app-wide actions and example input data. So after installation, it’s fully functional, even though you didn’t add a single line of JavaScript, and your job is to change the mocked actions to use your API.
* We have a standardised way of developing your own widgets and that covers things like scoped styling, telling what CSS classes should be opened to style from outside, creating mocked app-wide actions and writing example widget declaration, versioning and more.

115,kj36vp,Python,"Type hints for Pandas: What would we need, what can a linter actually know?","As I've learned more about Pandas, I've decided to delete some classes that I wrote because their respective functionalities could all be performed with data frames, and I figured that would make my code easier for other people to integrate into their code bases. Problem is, the classes I had created had very specific purposes, and thus when I used them in type annotations, there was no ambiguity as to what data a given function needed or returned and what properties that data had. So by switching to data frames, my hype hints are now less informative.

If Pandas had more robust type annotations, what properties would one want to be able to annotate for, and how effectively could they be validated outside of a runtime check?

Here's some examples that I've thought of:  
\`\`\`py  
ScoresDataFrame = pd.DataFrame\[index=\['class'\], columns=\['tp', 'fp', 'tn', 'fn'\], indextype=str, dtype=int\]

ClassificationDataFrame = pd.DataFrame\[index=\['class'\], columns=\['precision', 'recall', 'f1'\], indextype=str, dtype=float\]

WeatherDataFrame = pd.DataFrame\[columns=\['day', 'temp'\], dtype=\[datetime, float\]\]  
\`\`\`

The idea then is that each data frame type alias specifies what properties a data frame needs to have at a minimum to be usable in a context where that type alias is used.

There are obviously a lot of possibilities that these examples don't account for, such as what you'd need to know about the shape of the data frame or whether or not the order in which certain series are given matters. I'd be interested to know how others feel about this, as well as whether static analysis could ultimately tell you if the conditions set by a type alias are being met.","Type hints for Pandas: What would we need, what can a linter actually know?

116,kj35g8,Python,How we hacked Instagram: a bot for Android phones that's controlled by a Python script on your computer (and is not blocked by Instagram),"This story began a half a year ago, when my girlfriend started a blog in Instagram about Africa. And I was thinking how to help her to get more followers.

[Me and my girlfriend in South Africa](https://preview.redd.it/tlakim74ty661.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e97d7c0609c527394a64aee251d1f4fbbb5252)

We definitely weren't ready to pay any money to Instagram or any other service because it was a start or coronavirus pandemic and  we didn't know where economy will be in a couple of months.

So, we started with InstaPy, the most popular free and opensource Python script for Instagram automation. It simply makes some actions using your Instagram profile. You can leave the script work and it will like, follow, comment, etc. for hours.

# You can just mind your own business and your audience will slowly, but constantly grow.

But the problem was revealed pretty soon. The thing is that InstaPy uses Instagram browser version. And when you have 12k stars on Github, you become a troublesome fly for Instagram. So, they simply started to block actions after some amount, if they were made from a browser. You could continue using your phone, but in Instagram browser version you saw a ""softban"" – temporary block to do any actions.

The solution I've found was very simple: why using browser, if we can do absolutely the same in the app? Instagram will never start blocking mobile app users. It's too dangerous for them to block ""fair"" users that just spend a lot of time in the app.

It took just one day to build a prototype: a simple script that performed liking via official Android UI testing framework. I called it **Insomniac**. We tested it and found out that we really hacked Instagram: our script worked and was bringing audience for free. Instagram didn't block it. So, I added some minimal command line arguments and published it on Github.

[One of the earliest versions of Insomniac \(v1.5.3\). Now it's v3.5.0 and it's capable of much, much more](https://i.redd.it/bh2ddov7ty661.gif)

Here is how Insomniac works: you connect your phone to the computer with a USB cable. Then you use adb tool (adb stands for Android Device Bridge) to establish programmatic connection between the computer and the phone. You can even do it without a USB cable, just using your WiFi network (that's how magic on the gif above works). And then you run the script. That's all – everything else is handled by Insomniac. It works with any device and with emulators as well.

# It's too dangerous for Instagram to block ""fair"" users that just spend a lot of time in the app.

But never forget that even simple users that make too much likes/comments/follows may be ""softbanned"". It means that Instagram will temporary forbid them to do specific actions. That's why we implemented ""limits"" – settings that stop the script at some point for a couple of hours. Then Insomniac automatically opens Instagram app again and continues.

I never made any ads, but audience was constantly growing. People came to the Github page, saw how it works and tried themselves. Then they requested new features – more and more. After a month I found myself working on Insomniac as a part-time job. So I decided to make some paid ""extra"" features, that are not necessary to get more followers, but make it a bit faster and let you target on a particular audience.

Some users made pull requests on Github. The best PRs were made by a guy who's name is Asaf. Now we are partners, we discuss and implement new features every week.

[Screenshot by one of users: running Insomniac on emulators for 3 accounts simultaneously \(Windows\)](https://preview.redd.it/4xqwdhxety661.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1583cd65670b0b70ef92d78d858ff24a7f0d39de)

The main problem with Insomniac is that it requires some basic skills to start: you have to install Python and adb, use Command Prompt and command line arguments. At this moment we solved this problem by recording a course where we explain all steps in detail. We tried not only to show steps, but also explain what's happening.

So far Insomniac is able to:

* Like, watch stories and follow  – so, ""interact"" with users who are some specific blogger's followers, or are followed by specific user, or liked posts with specific hashtag.
* Unfollow users – all your followings, or only followed by the bot, or only those who didn't follow back
* Filter users by different parameters (followers/following/posts count, language, type of account, etc.)
* Scrape users. This is our know-how: a feature that makes using Insomniac even more safe and effective. You create an additional ""scrapping"" empty account and instruct the bot to collect (or ""scrape"") only users who are *your audience* (you find them using filters). Insomniac does the interaction using this ""scrapping"" account. It may be blocked for making too much actions but you won't worry because it's empty. And then you instruct the bot to interact with these ""scraped"" users  in your main account. So, you avoid extra profile views and interact with your target audience only, voila!

I'll share some links in case you're interested. Will also answer any questions!

[https://www.udemy.com/course/insomniac-guide/](https://www.udemy.com/course/insomniac-guide/) – the Udemy course I've told about","How we hacked Instagram: a bot for Android phones that's controlled by a Python script on your computer (and is not blocked by Instagram) This story began a half a year ago, when my girlfriend started a blog in Instagram about Africa. And I was thinking how to help her to get more followers.

[Me and my girlfriend in South Africa](https://preview.redd.it/tlakim74ty661.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e97d7c0609c527394a64aee251d1f4fbbb5252)

We definitely weren't ready to pay any money to Instagram or any other service because it was a start or coronavirus pandemic and  we didn't know where economy will be in a couple of months.

So, we started with InstaPy, the most popular free and opensource Python script for Instagram automation. It simply makes some actions using your Instagram profile. You can leave the script work and it will like, follow, comment, etc. for hours.

# You can just mind your own business and your audience will slowly, but constantly grow.

But the problem was revealed pretty soon. The thing is that InstaPy uses Instagram browser version. And when you have 12k stars on Github, you become a troublesome fly for Instagram. So, they simply started to block actions after some amount, if they were made from a browser. You could continue using your phone, but in Instagram browser version you saw a ""softban"" – temporary block to do any actions.

The solution I've found was very simple: why using browser, if we can do absolutely the same in the app? Instagram will never start blocking mobile app users. It's too dangerous for them to block ""fair"" users that just spend a lot of time in the app.

It took just one day to build a prototype: a simple script that performed liking via official Android UI testing framework. I called it **Insomniac**. We tested it and found out that we really hacked Instagram: our script worked and was bringing audience for free. Instagram didn't block it. So, I added some minimal command line arguments and published it on Github.

[One of the earliest versions of Insomniac \(v1.5.3\). Now it's v3.5.0 and it's capable of much, much more](https://i.redd.it/bh2ddov7ty661.gif)

Here is how Insomniac works: you connect your phone to the computer with a USB cable. Then you use adb tool (adb stands for Android Device Bridge) to establish programmatic connection between the computer and the phone. You can even do it without a USB cable, just using your WiFi network (that's how magic on the gif above works). And then you run the script. That's all – everything else is handled by Insomniac. It works with any device and with emulators as well.

# It's too dangerous for Instagram to block ""fair"" users that just spend a lot of time in the app.

But never forget that even simple users that make too much likes/comments/follows may be ""softbanned"". It means that Instagram will temporary forbid them to do specific actions. That's why we implemented ""limits"" – settings that stop the script at some point for a couple of hours. Then Insomniac automatically opens Instagram app again and continues.

I never made any ads, but audience was constantly growing. People came to the Github page, saw how it works and tried themselves. Then they requested new features – more and more. After a month I found myself working on Insomniac as a part-time job. So I decided to make some paid ""extra"" features, that are not necessary to get more followers, but make it a bit faster and let you target on a particular audience.

Create a program to simulate a number lottery. In the lottery, 6 basic numbers from numbers are drawn from 1 to 49 and 2 bonus numbers from numbers 1-9 (numbers are not repeated within one tip or draw). 

 Create a program that: 

\- at the entrance reads tips on 6 numbers from the user + 2 bonus. The user enters numbers in one input line and separate them with spaces - bonus numbers are last two entered  
\- simulates a draw and prints 6 + 2 drawn numbers    
\- compares the drawn numbers with all the tips of the lottery participants and yours. Tips lottery participants are listed in the text file lottery.txt. There is 6+ on each line 2 numbers separated by a space 

 \- write the table ""winnings forecasts"" 

 \- The € 10,000,000 jackpot was won by those who hit all 8 numbers   
\- otherwise (if not all numbers or less than 6 basic numbers are guessed) the win depends on the number of guessed basic numbers as follows:     
\- if the participant guesses x basic numbers, the win is x \* 100.000 € \* y, where y is the smaller of the two guessed bonus numbers   
\- so in addition to the jackpot, the highest possible win is € 4,800,000 (if he guesses 6 base numbers and the smaller of the two bonus numbers is 8 -&gt; second not guessed correctly), and the lowest win of € 100,000 (if he guesses 1 number and the lesser of the bonus is 1) - winning € 0 is not a win, but a number We will list bettors who did not guess anything separately below the table   
\- list the table in ascending order according to the number of guessed basic numbers and then descending according to winnings   
\- Do not list amounts that no one has won

 \- if someone won the jackpot, write ""jackpot"" instead of the word ""win"" - as on sample output

\- separate the table at the top and bottom with dashes as shown in the example

\- do not list the number of zero winnings and write your winnings below the table  
\- a good solution: store numbers in a matrix - eg rows as a number guessed, columns as a smaller bonus number - Wrong way of solving: in one field the amount of winnings in the other number of winners - it also depends on the number of guessed numbers, ie the one who guesses 1, has a chance to get up to 800,000, and he who guesses 2 can only have 200,000, or these winnings can match, but number of guessed numbers no   
\- also a bad solution: separate fields for the number of guessed numbers 

\- you do not have to deal with invalid entries

\- some tips you might miss: sum (array) - counts all elements in the array

(must be int); .split (); random.shuffle (); .sort (); min (field) - selects

the smallest element in the field; field = field2 \[: 6\] - puts the first 6 elements from field2 into the field

field = field2 \[6:\] - puts all elements from field2 in the field except the first 6

Does anyone have any suggestions on trying to find something like this?  I know that most employers would rather have someone full time.   Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",1

A simple script to forward all the messages of one chat (indivisual/group/channel) to another. Made using Telethon. Can be used to back up the contents of a chat to another place.

## 

[Telethon Script](https://preview.redd.it/cx3kvu4fzw661.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43bf7442f0896867f491b4f0b2387a5503d8207)

## Signing in

First of all you need to have your Telegram account's `api_id` and `api_hash`. Learn [how to get](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/basic/signing-in.html) them.

## Installation

* Clone this repo and move into it to get started.

&amp;#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward.git &amp;&amp; cd telegram-chat-forward

* Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

&amp;#8203;

    python3 -m venv venv &amp;&amp; . venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

&gt;Note: For Windows, the process for activating a virtual environment is different, search Google.

## Setup

You must have the `api_id` and `api_hash` as environment variables. You may simply create a file named `.env` in the project directory and paste the following into it.

    api_id=12345
    api_hash=kjfjfk9r9JOIJOIjoijf9wr0w

**Replace the above values with the actual values for your telegram account.**

After this you need to create and fill up the `config.ini` file with your forwarding configurations.

## Configuration

* The `from` and `to` in the `config.ini` has to be a username/phone/link/chat\_id of the chat.
* **To confirm that you are using the correct** `from` **and** `to` **run the** `get_chat_info.py` **script.**
* You may have as many as forwarding pairs as you wish. Make sure to give a unique header to each pair. Follow the syntax shown below.

&amp;#8203;

    [name of forward1]
    ; in the above line give any name as you wish
    ; the square brackets around the name should remain
    from = whatAz
    to = testWha
    offset = 0
    ; the offset will auto-update, keep it zero initially
    [another name]
    ; the name of section must be unique
    from = someone
    to = another
    offset = 0

&gt;**Note**:Any line starting with `;` in a `.ini` file, is treated as a comment.

## Offset

* When you run the script for the first time, keep `offset=0`.
* When the script runs, the value of offset in `config.ini` gets updated automatically.
* Offset is basically the id of the last message forwarded from `from` to `to`.
* When you run the script next time, the messages in `from` having an id greater than offset (newer messages) will be forwarded to  `to`. That is why it is important not to loose the value of `offset`.

## Execution

After setting up the `config.ini`, run the `forwarder.py` script.

    python3 forwarder.py

You have to login for the first time using your phone number (inter-national format) and login code.

A session file called `forwarder.session` will be generated. Please don't delete this and make sure to keep this file secret.

Feel free to ask your questions in the [Discussion section](https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward/discussions). For bugs and feature requests use the [issues](https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward/issues/new) section of this repo.

## Extra

To get all information about any particular chat:

* Run the script `run_chat_info.py`.
* Open Telegram and send `.id` to any chat to get the chat id.
* Send `.info` to any chat to get details of the chat.
* When you are done, come back to your terminal and press &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt; to stop.","Learn How you can forward all messages of a telegram chat to another, using Python # [telegram-chat-forward](https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward)

What if you could easily automate the process of sending WhatsApp messages with only 3 lines of code ? Don't worry. I am not writing about any paid API or service.

All you need is Google Chrome and Chrome Driver (same or compatible versions of both)

First of all, if you want to follow along, open your Python interactive shell. But before that, just `pip install wappdriver.`

    
    from wappdriver import WhatsApp
    with WhatsApp() as bot:
         bot.send('aahnik',  # name of recipient
                  'hi send by a bot')  # message
        # The name of the recipient should be in your contacts

When you will run this code for the first time, you will be prompted to enter the path of Chrome Driver Installation. You will also need to scan the QR Code, to sign in to WhatsApp web for the first time. 

And thats it! You have successfuly sent your first message.

As above-mentioned, I wrote my first script that will read any data from my router like which devices are active/inactive per Wi-Fi or Ethernet and send it to me per e-mail. The reason why I wrote this script is that my mother never answers her phone, so I *could* check if she is at home and watching TV via IPTV or surfing with her phone since IPTV receiver or phone is never disconnected from the router.

The script works only if I run it on a device that is connected with my router. I don't know how to run it remotely, but I came up with an idea:

I could expand the script so it will scan for my inbox and trigger the e-mail once a specific e-mail has received. For example: I would send an e-mail to my e-mail with the word ""send router data"" and if the python script detects an email including these words, it should trigger to send the e-mail.

Hi people, I write this post to share a portfolio optimization library that I developed called Riskfolio-Lib. This library was designed to help investment managers to run complex portfolio optimization models like: CVaR, CDaR, Omega Ratio, Worst Case, Risk Parity, among others; without effort. Also, it allows to include any kind of linear constraints that are require by clients or regulators like constraints on asset classes, countries, risk factors, concentration, industry, among others.

Some of key functionalities that Riskfolio-Lib offers:

* Portfolio optimization with 4 objective functions (Minimum Risk, Maximum Return, Maximum Risk Adjusted Return Ratio and Maximum Utility Function)
* Portfolio optimization with 10 convex risk measures (Std. Dev., MAD, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, among others)
* Risk Parity Portfolio optimization with 7 convex risk measures (Std. Dev., MAD, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, among others)
* Worst Case Mean Variance Portfolio optimization.
* Portfolio optimization with Black Litterman model.
* Portfolio optimization with Risk Factors model.
* Portfolio optimization with constraints on tracking error and turnover.
* Portfolio optimization with short positions and leveraged portfolios.
* Tools for build efficient frontier for 10 risk measures.
* Tools for build linear constraints on assets, asset classes and risk factors.
* Tools for build views on assets and asset classes.
* Tools for calculate risk measures.
* Tools for calculate risk contributions per asset.
* Tools for calculate uncertainty sets for mean vector and covariance matrix.
* Tools for estimate loadings matrix (Stepwise Regression and Principal Components Regression).

Hi people, I write this post to share a portfolio optimization library that I developed called Riskfolio-Lib. This library was designed to help investment managers to run complex portfolio optimization models like: CVaR, CDaR, Omega Ratio, Worst Case, Risk Parity, among others; without effort. Also, it allows to include any kind of linear constraints that are require by clients or regulators like constraints on asset classes, countries, risk factors, concentration, industry, among others.

Some of key functionalities that Riskfolio-Lib offers:

* Portfolio optimization with 4 objective functions (Minimum Risk, Maximum Return, Maximum Risk Adjusted Return Ratio and Maximum Utility Function)
* Portfolio optimization with 10 convex risk measures (Std. Dev., MAD, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, among others)
* Risk Parity Portfolio optimization with 7 convex risk measures (Std. Dev., MAD, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, among others)
* Worst Case Mean Variance Portfolio optimization.
* Portfolio optimization with Black Litterman model.
* Portfolio optimization with Risk Factors model.
* Portfolio optimization with constraints on tracking error and turnover.
* Portfolio optimization with short positions and leveraged portfolios.
* Tools for build efficient frontier for 10 risk measures.
* Tools for build linear constraints on assets, asset classes and risk factors.
* Tools for build views on assets and asset classes.
* Tools for calculate risk measures.
* Tools for calculate risk contributions per asset.
* Tools for calculate uncertainty sets for mean vector and covariance matrix.
* Tools for estimate loadings matrix (Stepwise Regression and Principal Components Regression).
* Tools for visualizing portfolio properties and risk measures.

I would appreciate your comments, thoughts and suggestions.",1

![video](1gudl9x0yj661)

A fine-tuned Yolov4 model is used to get the location of the ball. Then, I implemented SORT tracking algorithm to keep track of each individual ball and filter out the misdetection noise. Lastly, I have applied some image registration techniques to deal with slight camera shift on each clip.

I'm still trying to improve it! Feel free to follow this project, also check out the Todo list.

As a data scientist, I often used to look out for external data sources that could be relevant to my core field but there was always a problem to find open-source data sets that do corresponds to what you are looking for at a level of perfection or free Application Programming Interfaces that would give you access to data. In this case, web scraping could be one of the modern technology solutions to get more data.

**What is web scraping?**

Web scraping is all about collecting unstructured data available on websites. This could be achieved manually by a human user or by the use of technology. The latter could of course gather data much faster as compared to human users and that is why we are going to focus on this. Is it therefore technically possible to collect all the data of a website within a couple of minutes?. However, the legality of this practice is not well defined. Websites usually describe in their terms of use and in their robots.txt file whether they allow scrapers or not.

* can now scrape multiple subreddits and outputs a separate file for each 
* streamlined IO for minimizing opens, reads, and writes
* improved readability by separating work into multiple functions
* discord server functionality to post text files to a discord channel

Currently am racking my brain for any other improvements to this project. Wondering if I could get any constructive criticism or advice on where to go from here. Best I can think of is implementing a basic form of NLP or AI to analyze sentiment since most existing programs do implement some form of NLP, however that seems like a daunting task.

I suppose you are all familiar with the pattern:

    PS C:\path_to_my\project&gt; python -m venv venv
    PS C:\path_to_my\project&gt; .\venv\Scripts\activate
    (venv) PS C:\path_to_my\project&gt;

I used this pattern a lot, but had a need to keep my virtual environments away from the project folder(s). I searched for a tool for it and since there were none that I would felt okay with, I created a simple tool of my own. This weekend I have spent polishing (&amp; documenting) it, and here it is: [venvlink](https://github.com/np-8/venvlink). In a nutshell:

* It creates virtual environment outside your project folder, to a centralized location using `python -m venv myproj`
* It creates a proxy (""link"") `activate` script on your project folder, so the virtual environment is still activated with `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.

https://preview.redd.it/8xzsu6tp4e661.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2a4a046e3354381b5596ca86f9765b3f8debe5

I have highlighted many potential motivations on using such a tool in the GitHub [README.md](https://github.com/np-8/venvlink), but to pick a few:

* It keeps virtual environment files outside automatic backups (Dropbox, OneDrive, ..)
* It provides possibility to keep your virtual environments on one location, but still activate them without need to remember their names, with the good ol' `.\venv\Scripts\activate` script.
* It gives the possibility to share/reuse virtual environments easily.

I have been using the tool myself for about 1.5 months or so, and since I noticed it improved my development experience, I thought of creating good documentation for it and sharing it with the open source community. For now, it only supports Windows, since I am Windows user, but I suppose cross-platform support could be doable in the future.

I would be happy to hear any comments/thoughts on the project.","Virtual environment tool for Windows - venvlink Hello fellow pythonistas,

Hi there!

I'm happy to announce that I released a new version of [reader](https://github.com/lemon24/reader), a Python Atom / RSS feed reader library.

**reader** takes care of the core functionality required to build a feed reader, allowing you to focus on what makes **yours** different.

What's new since my last post here:

* Python 3.9 and Windows support
* an extensive [user guide](https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html)
* [pagination](https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#pagination) for methods that return feeds and entries
* methods to [count feeds and entries](https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#counting-things), [disable updates for specific feeds](https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#disabling-feed-updates), and [change the URL of a feed](https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#changing-feed-urls)
* lots of smaller documentation, usability, and performance improvements

Why make your own feed reader? So you can:

* have full control over your data
* control what features it has or doesn’t have
* decide how much you pay for it
* make sure it doesn’t get closed while you’re still using it
* really, it’s [easier than you think](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/10/26/fred/)

For more information, see the  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lemon24/reader) and the [documentation](https://reader.readthedocs.io/).","reader 1.12 released – a library to create your own RSS feed reader &amp;#x200B;

436,kgfuj3,Python,Sharing Work,"Hi everyone! So, I'm a computer science major and I just took an introductory class so there was a mix of people who have no interest in computer science. Anyway, I'm pretty good with Python so I did pretty well in the class. In the final week of class, a couple of my classmates reached out to me after class to ask if I could help them with their projects, and I found this to be a compliment at first, but then after we sat down and I asked them what they had done so far and what they needed help with they had literally nothing (mind you these projects were due weeks ago). Basically what ended up happening is they just kept asking to see what I had so they could copy it but I was uncomfortable sharing my work, so I didn't and pretended I got an important phone call and had to go home from school early for winter break, even though this wasn't true. I did get all my work done early so that I could go home that day so it wasn't completely a lie.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is if anyone else runs into these issues and how you maintain academic integrity while trying to help other people who clearly just want to copy your work. I know this is directly related to Python, but I feel like people don't realize copying code, even if you change the variables, is still just as bad as copying someone else's essay or exam. I feel like if they actually wanted help and at least had written some code, I would have been totally okay with helping them develop code and could have done it without showing them what I had, but the whole situation just didn't feel right to me. I know it's kinda mean that I just left but I promise I did try to offer advice but they clearly just wanted to see my answers.","Sharing Work Hi everyone!

This project takes your baseball pitching clips and **automatically** generates the overlay. A fine-tuned Yolov4 model is used to get the location of the ball. Then, I implemented SORT tracking algorithm to keep track of each individual ball. Lastly, I will apply some image registration techniques to deal with slight camera shift on each clip.

I'm still trying to improve it! Feel free to follow this project, also check out the Todo list.

I have an exciting update to the Audio Reactive LEDs project I did a while back. My last update made the installation easier and since then, I've had a lot of people ask me if we can play audio off the pi directly without needing a mic and this update does exactly that. 

Before I talk more about the details, here are some links:

GitHub: [https://github.com/naztronaut/dancyPi-audio-reactive-led/tree/no\_mic](https://github.com/naztronaut/dancyPi-audio-reactive-led/tree/no_mic)

Written Tutorial: [https://www.easyprogramming.net/raspberrypi/audio\_reactive\_holiday\_leds.php](https://www.easyprogramming.net/raspberrypi/audio_reactive_holiday_leds.php)

This project is in a branch because I'm still working on making this whole thing be headless. The mic-less version only works when run from the Pi GUI. I need to figure out how to have Pyaudio see the output of a virtual speaker in CLI, for some reason, it doesn't want to do that. 

The way it is set up now, you can play anything on the Pi and the lights should pick it up, including playing audio in CLI, using a python script, opening YouTube on a browser, running Spotify, etc. It all works. 

This only works with a USB or Bluetooth speaker. You cannot use the audio jack on the Pi for this. With the audio jack, you can either listen to audio or make the lights dance. You can't have both. 

I also added a couple of extra visualizations (scroll\_in and scroll\_quad). Will be adding more as I get more comfortable with numpy. 

In future updates, I want to try to make this thing headless where you can just plug it in, and the visualization service runs without any user interaction. 

I also want to try and find a way to send audio via the network from your computer. This is currently possible if you use this project with a NodeMCU instead of a Pi, but I want to add on a Pi version. 

Happy to take questions.

This can be useful on instances such as trying to infer the impact a national TV commercial had on sales of the company (or any other Marketing campaign for that matter) or even how certain news impact the stock pricing of publicly traded companies.

I have been making a series on OOP on my website. I was hoping for some feedback regarding completed topics and suggestions for further topics. 

**Topics covered so far:** [Articles can be found here](https://www.codearmo.com/python-tutorial/init-method-and-Attributes)

* \_\_init\_\_ &amp; attributes
* Properties
* Add functions/methods
* Static/class methods
* \_\_str\_\_ and \_\_repr\_\_
* Comparison methods \_\_eq\_\_ etc
* Arithmetic methods \_\_add\_\_ etc
* Custom Sequence objects with Fib numbers
* Single Inheritance
* Context managers
* Slots
* Enumerations

&amp;#x200B;

**Topics in the pipeline**

* **Multiple inheritance** (Struggling to find a good short concise real life example of usage. Considering a database mixin currently, some suggestions here would be great )
* **Unit Testing**. Boring as \*/## but I guess it is important 
* **Singletons????** Even harder to find a good use case for these. 
* **Descriptors**. Very interested to hear ideas about how you use descriptors! I have sort of half coded a phone number validator and usual string / real number validator, but would be interested in more ideas.
* **Metaclasses**. Only really seen few basic examples of how these are used. I sort of understand the mechanics, but this is for much later since I really don't understand them well enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anything I am missing?

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to provide short examples that refrain as much as possible from using the *foo &amp; bar* examples, as I find this frustrating at myself.

I wanted to share my opinion with all of you, i am a nineteen year old datasci student and previously i attended a cisco course where i worked with java, html, css, javascript which by far, in my mind java is the most mangled and non-beginner friendly language. its a very disgusting language and im sure the lads over at r/java would disagree. 

I have only been with python for about 2.5 years. and i can tell you for a fact that its the most relaxing language/thing i have ever done. heck this beats asmr (not that im into it). can i marry python? 

the IDE i started with was Notepad++ for a long time starting with java, then i moved to Atom for a few months and lastly I'm sticking with VSCode. I internwine using it with Anaconda tools and i absolutely love it.

People wake up in the morning and think about what to eat for breakfast, my breakfast, lunch and dinner is python. its so soothing to use. i cannot imagine not using it, ever. even when i retire. python is now apart of me, till death does us part.

This is a simple script to help you send stuff to your phone via FTP

[https://github.com/BruceJi7/FTP-Transfer](https://github.com/BruceJi7/FTP-Transfer)

I ride the subway and it's a great time to catch up on TV (The Mandalorian is just great), but the signal sucks so I can't stream.

Since I use an iPhone there's no external SD slot, and weirdly dropbox's 'make available offline' files still need a connection.

So, I found an app (FTPManager) and I wrote this script to send files to my phone.

It uses only default libraries so no need to pip install.

614,kevm83,Python,Why should i use Anaconda?,"Hello everyone,

i am an engineer and not a computer scientist. Don't know much about computers and coding in general, but i had to learn Java a while ago. Back then i was realy overwhelmed by installing all that. The instructions in this lecture were shit and it didn't work at all. I ended up only working in the university and almost messed up my entire laptop. And for me back then it was kind of impossible to uninstall all the useless stuff again.

Way later i tought myself python. I was affraid this might happen again.

For me it was pretty complicated to get an overview about all the packages and how to install python and what exactly I even need to install and all that in the beginning and sometimes it still is. 

So for me personally it was a huge breakthrough when i used anaconda for the first time. I had some problems by installing packages that messed everything up, even when i was more experienced already, but with anaconda i could just easily create a new environment and reinstall everything without going to deep into the whole windows and computer thing. 

So as a beginner it was extremely helpful for me and i still like the fact, that i can manage different environments so easily and basically play around with packages without any problems or risks of messing everything up.

But what i was wondering. What is still out there and what are the downsides of anaconda? From my point i don't see any disadvantages so far or do i just have wrong imaginations of how python works without Anaconda? How about Linux and macOS?

I hope you are having a good day. As a programming learner, I have been working on a projects to learn more about databases and creating APIs. I recently made a tool that allows people to get news from the past. Here is a little bit about it:

The News Archives API is a *super* simple application programming interface that allows anyone to get news of the past.

### What problem does this solve?

In my house, many newspapers of historical events are stuffed into my garage cabinets, like papers from 9/11, presidential elections of 2008, ’12, and ’16, the first quarantines from covid-19, and much more. These are stored so that in, say, ten years, I can see what was the news on this very important day. Maybe even in hundreds of years, someone will come across my former garage and get a primary source of world-changing events from my time (unlikely).

There’s a lot of problems with this though. Stacks of newspapers take up a *ton* of space in my garage. It’s hard to find a single newspaper without looking through *all* of them, and they get lost and destroyed easily.

So I solved this like any bored developer would do… move it to tech!

All the problems stated earlier can be solved… with some new features too:

* It’s automated, so no more doing the work of storing news myself.
* I can store *all* articles, instead of just a few.
* You can look for articles containing a keyword in their title.
* News can be logged for the public, instead of just me.
* Anyone can embed this into their own application.

Try out the API: [https://github.com/gadhagod/News-Archives](https://github.com/gadhagod/News-Archives).

Please let me know any suggestions or give me any feedback. It's still a work in progress, and of course, there is a lot to be done.","News Archives API Hey people,

I am not aware if there are other flask-oriented kick-start project apps, but there might just be others. Some of the features are:

* Setting up Project name/ root app name / version / description / main Blueprint
* Creates a config file with a base config class and a development inheriting from the base class, which config is used is decided by environment variables.
* Sets up logging
* It also comes with an option to create and populate Heroku files (Procfile, runtime.txt) based on your runtime.

654,kei0qx,Python,gttk: A project to apply GTK themes to Tkinter/ttk applications,"Hey Pythonistas!

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I started a Python package named [`ttkthemes`](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes). I didn't really even intend for it to become a project unto itself. I think it's amazing how much it's being used, even though I may have been a little more excited than appropriate passing 100 stars on GitHub. Currently it includes 19 themes, from eye-hurting to quite nice, created by a lot of different people.

However, the number of themes available for `ttk` is really limited overall. Not many people still write `Tcl`\-code, and those who do generally have better things to do than to build new themes. Fortunately, themes can be created relatively easily from GTK-2.0 themes, but it still takes quite a bit of work.

This is why, when I found out about `tile-gtk`, I was immediately excited. I've turned a fork of [`tile-gtk`](https://github.com/xiaq/tile-gtk), named [`gtkTtk`](https://github.com/Geballin/gtkTtk), into a Python package named [`gttk`](https://github.com/TkinterEP/python-gttk) . This package loads a C-library that makes GTK do the actual drawing of the widgets. This lets you use (theoretically) *any* GTK-2.0 theme! On most Linux machines, this will even make your application look properly native.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x4tz50p13m561.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc242dd28378680aeeae689dbafa5a923057f5a7

Above is a screenshot of eight different themes loaded with `gttk`. As you can see `gttk` is not perfect. `tile-gtk` never included support for the `ttk.Treeview` widget, and the colour of the text and such needs adjusting for the dark themes. Other than that, there are a few graphical glitches here and there (when using the Breeze theme, for example), but it works pretty well overall.

Over the past week I've worked hard on configuring a Windows build. I am now at a point where I've gotten AppVeyor and a local VM to build proper wheels that allow `gttk` to load on a clean Windows 64-bit installation, even if nothing but Python with Tkinter is installed. Any pixmap theme can then be loaded.

There's some preliminary documentation written up in the README of the project repository. If you have a Tkinter (with ttk widgets) application with a relatively complicated UI lying around, consider giving it a go: Let me know if and how well it works. I'd love to have some feedback, not in the least to get an idea of whether this is something people actually want.

If there's sufficient interest, I'll continue developing and documenting the package. Maybe there's even room in my schedule to resurrect [`tile-qt`](https://github.com/xiaq/tile-qt) ([`qttk`](https://github.com/RedFantom/python-qttk)) and port it to Qt 5 to make it work on modern Linux distributions.

**TL;DR**: If you have a Tkinter.ttk application lying around, please consider giving [`gttk`](https://github.com/TkinterEP/python-gttk) a go. I would love some feedback on the project.

Long story short I got made redundant and the company has given me a 3k training voucher that I can use for any training within 6 months. Unfortunately I cant cash it out. 

I am an infrastructure engineer with an aim to be a Dev ops engineer one day , also I enjoy scripting in powershell  but never really dedicated my self to python. 

I keep hearing its the best language to start with. 

I found a course at generalaseembly for python was wondering if its worth it. 

I know I can learn everything for free but I think I prefer some class room based learning with some mentor ship. 

Any other ideas welcome.

676,keb6ve,Python,I made a defaultlist!,"I really love the \`defaultdict\` and wanted a list equivalent, so I set out to learn how the builtin \`list\` works and how one could emulate it's behavior with a ""defaultlist"". I do so in my [coinflip](https://pypi.org/project/coinflip/) package and expose it in the `coinflip.collections` submodule.

Basically, this is what [abstract base classes](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/#abstract-base-classes-in-python) were made for—specifically the `MutableSequence`, which makes copy the `list` interface quite simple. Filling out the following methods will automatically get methods like `append()` also included in our `defaultlist`.

    class defaultlist(MutableSequence):
        def __getitem__(self, i):
            ...
    
        def __setitem__(self, i, value):
            ...
    
        def __delitem__(self, i):
            ...
    
        def __len__(self):
            ...
            
        def insert(self):
                ...

I initialised this `defaultlist` by mirroring the `defaultdict(default_factory=None)` method, passing `default_factory` to an internal private `defaultdict`. I filled the indices with `None` by default (i.e. pass in a ""none factory"" method), otherwise you will get a `KeyError` using previously-unaccessed indices.

        def __init__(self, default_factory=None):
            self._ddict = defaultdict(default_factory or defaultlist._none_factory)
    
        @staticmethod
        def _none_factory():
            return None

The accessor methods (get, set and delete items) would have indices just be keys in the private `defaultdict`.

        def __getitem__(self, i):
            return self._ddict[i]
            
        def __setitem__(self, i, v):
            self._ddict[i] = v
    
        def __delitem__(self, i):
            del self._ddict[i]

... but don't forgot one needs to update the private dictionary accordingly when items are added and/or removed. Infact, there are some other less-obvious behaviors of a `list` which require making design decisions, so I'll leave it all for my blog post [here](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/2020/12/08/defaultlist/).

This was a super fun and educative process for me, and I hope it can get others excited about custom container types in Python too!","I made a defaultlist!

679,kearcp,Python,Python tips: how to reuse a generator within one function?,"Generators can help you write reusable and scalable Python code, but the problem is that complicated processing often requires using the same data multiple times. However, the issue with generators is that they exhaust themselves, meaning they can produce results only once. Trying to retrieve new output from an exhausted generator will lead to a StopIteration exception.

Even more troubling is that for loops, list(), tuple(), set(), and many other functions in Python expect a StopIteration exception to be raised when passed-in generators are exhausted, which is why it's handled in these methods. So, you might find yourself in a situation when your code returns a wrong result, instead of throwing an error.

691,ke7s5d,Python,First time using an API (Scryfall),"Good morning all! I'm someone who enjoys making decks for Magic the gathering and one of the best databases for that is Scryfall. It is usually my go to site. Normally what I do is I'll sort for a certain card type and color combination, then copy and paste each name into a notepad or deckbuilder. However sometimes this is kind of annoying if you have a ton of pages to parse through. So I decided to make a program that allows users to input the parameters they want and have it print all of those cards to an excel file. It is my first time working with an API so I know I can make improvements. any feed back would be great and features you might want to see added. 

Features I would like to add as of right now. 

* Power/toughness for creature cards
* Pricing of the cards
* A GUI 

My code is probably not the cleanest as I have only started with Python about two months ago. However I want to get even better.

Thanks for your feedback and thoughts!

I am looking to see if there is a way I can create a project that will allow me to input dates with specific details and give me the end result either in text form or a gui that I would manually transfer to an excel.

For an example.. I have a maintenance action that needs to be accomplished every 21 days, that starts on a tuesday and has to have two weeks in between. If i add the dates that the maintenance actions are due, could it calculate what the best date would be to plot said actions and then do it for every other action until all are calculate based on the 21 days required to complete the action and skipping 2 weeks so the next action can be plotted?

I am still fairly new to python and I thought this would be a good project for work to help us decrease man hours and help me learn something new.","Help on project

**Spam Detection using Machine Learning**

Describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if the probability that a incoming spam mail is related to the total presence of the word “Free”, using Bayes’ theorem the word “Free” can be used to more accurately assess the probability of a mail being spam than can be done without knowledge of the words within the mail.

The book is called - shockingly - Python for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I know we all dislike MATLAB here, and I always found it somewhat discouraging in school that MATLAB was the preferred ""programming"" language for not very good reasons (Simulink notwithstanding). So, I gathered a collection of programs that I had written to show that Python was more capable than MATLAB for most tasks. I was introduced to programming via an introductory CS course in Java in college. I taught myself Python during the summer after that class, and I took a few more CS courses during school. 


I created a website for the book [here](https://pymae.github.io). The website has about 1/3 of Chapter 5: Modeling a 2-body orbit in 2D and 3D so you can get a feel for the style of the books and do a test drive. I also created a GitHub site [here](https://github.com/alexkenan/pymae) where you can see all of the completed programs and some other small goodies. 


Here is the table of contents:

* Intro chapter on how to download Python via Anaconda distribution and getting started with Python syntax

* Using FizzBuzz to show how to write a Python program

* Graphing thrust required and thrust available for an Airbus A321 at three different altitudes with Matplotlib

* Graphing dynamic pressure as a function of time for a rocket launch with Matplotlib

* Getting and plotting airfoil coordinates with Requests and Matplotlib

* Modeling a satellite’s orbit around Earth with PyAstronomy and Matplotlib

* Creating a GUI to convert units with Tkinter and Pint

* Introduction to web scraping (Requests and BeautifulSoup4) and exporting data to Excel (Openpyxl)

* Modeling camera shutter effect on an aircraft’s propeller with Tkinter and Numpy

* Making pdf reports of Python code with Pweave


The book is available on Amazon, Apple Books, Google Play Store, Barnes and Noble, and Leanpub as a DRM-free ebook or PDF thing for $9.99, and a paperback at Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble for $29.99. The target audience is more in the engineering space (both students and working engineers), but I know I broke some PEP conventions, so feel free to browse through the programs and critique them! 

My focus for these programs was primarily getting them to work, but I also wanted to style the book to start with very linear, functional programming and eventually sort of get to topics like DRY. I did not go into classes, though the GUI chapter probably could have been changed to incorporate classes without too much of a fuss. I also wanted to show a little bit of the troubleshooting and debugging process; I think a lot of early programmers get discouraged by bugs and by resources which do the classic [""Step 1: Draw a circle, Step 2; Draw the rest of the owl""](https://cdn.dopl3r.com//media/memes_files/how-to-draw-a-panda-step-1-step-2-step-3-step-4-J7ekJ.jpg) approach. Showing the debugging process shows insight into how to think, which is always a valuable skill to build.

I am also a big believer in easy access to education, so if you are interested and cannot afford $9.99 (or the minimum $4.99 price set by Leanpub), send me an email listed at the bottom of the About the Author page!","I wrote a book about Python for mechanical and aerospace engineering!

You have to first create one, then switch into it, make sure you update the python interpreter because otherwise, your virtualenv might have security issues.

No other programming language that I know has something like that. 

Node for example has npm, which basically just installs packages in a subfolder in the project, you don't have to create a virtualenv, then switch into it, etc. Maven and composer work similarly.

If you need a different python version, well just install one and specify the interpreter instead of just using python or python3.

In my opinion, the whole concept only causes confusion, especially with new python programmers, and does not have any advantage compared to how the packaging tools of other programming languages work.

Additionally, it looks like we have to be careful about pipes being closed by the reading process. Sadly, the issue isn't obvious, since it is only triggered, if the pipe's buffer is exhausted -- just like the Unicode issue is often masked by a lot of STDIN data being ASCII.

The output display will be 22"" HDMI capacitive touchscreens with a minimum horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels, and there can be virtually zero human-perceptable latency.

* django-ORM and SQLAlchemy are popular options
* They predate python-3.7 dataclasses
* They have their own abstractions (models, base classes and types)

856,kd2j19,Python,Using Python to Identify Pokemon | Part 1 of Pokemon AI Python Project [Intermediate Showcase],"I am working on a project that will use AI/ML to make decisions in an online Pokemon battle. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with tensor flow to create a model that can learn Pokemon based on images and then identify them later on.

Here is a video explaining the project: [https://youtu.be/4XiOnL8ug5w](https://youtu.be/4XiOnL8ug5w)

Note: The video was meant for a general audience, so I will provide more info below.

This project does NOT involve any hacking/modding of a Nintendo Switch. I use capture software to mirror what is on my TV to my laptop. Using the mirror screen, I take 6 snippets, one for each Pokemon. This is then fed into the model to identify the Pokemon. Once the Pokemon have been identified, a display pops-up showing their stats.","Using Python to Identify Pokemon | Part 1 of Pokemon AI Python Project [Intermediate Showcase] I am working on a project that will use AI/ML to make decisions in an online Pokemon battle.

857,kd2htc,Python,I wrote a Python book for advanced beginners (giveaway inside),"Dear all, 

 my journey with Python started in 2015 and quickly I became familiar with the basics of the language. However, after that, I struggled to apply these foundations in real-life projects since I do not have a background in CS. The [book that is published now](https://www.elektor.com/python-3-for-science-and-engineering-applications) is written for my younger self. If you are an advanced beginner and know about the foundations of Python but want to get a better understanding of central concepts in programming like algorithms, recursion, or backtracking, this might be helpful for you. I tried to find interesting examples from many areas of science. These are real-life problems and puzzles that will make you think. Some are tough to crack but fascinating. Of course, in the book the main ideas on how to solve the tasks are explained in combination with special Python tools and tricks. Btw, it was important to me that all tasks are solvable without any other addons or installations, just fire up Python 3.6+ and you are good to go! A few examples of what is covered:  

 - Computing Pi with arbitrary precision
 - Finding good strategies for games and gambling with simple simulations
 - Generating *really* long palindromes/sentences
 - Encrypting messages
 - Simple applications of multithreading 

Luckily, my publisher Elektor agreed to have a small giveaway. The first 5 persons to write an email to **marketing@elektor.com** will receive a printed copy of the book (valid it until 15th of Dec. 2020). Please use the keyword **Python3Book** and include your *postal* address so they can ship it to you!","I wrote a Python book for advanced beginners (giveaway inside) Dear all,

## How Overflows Come to be

Basically a software solution works with variables. These variables include different types such as characters and numbers. Of course, we all have heard at some point that a computer works with zeros and ones, which are called bits. If a variable gets defined it is usually limited to a certain number of bits.

Let us assume that we define a variable which contains a natural number with 4 bits. Now we can represent numbers from 0 up to 15:

https://preview.redd.it/isr3yoar14561.png?width=224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a5421a212d2db163d2c2acecae34b4948547ea

So, what happens if we want to perform an addition that can no longer be represented with 4 bits? For example, if we calculate 12 + 7 with 4 bit variables:

https://preview.redd.it/35rbcllt14561.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ef05b1f51f4593cf00ce4b616cf066fa3194cd

The surprising result is 3 and not 19, since 19 can not be represented by a 4 bit variable. To express the correct result we would need an extra bit, i.e. 5 instead of 4 bits.

This problem is called an “overflow”, which occurs when you try to store a number in a variable that does not fit into its range Hence, the number is larger than the maximum number which can be represented by that variable. Typically, this situation appears while performing arithmetic operations.

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that many software applications are using 32 bit variables that allow them to represent numbers in the range from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. Developers often assume that roughly 2 billion positive numbers are quite sufficient and ignore the fact that an overflow can occur over time. In this case, just like in our demonstrative example, an overflow exists. If its data type is an integer, it is called an “integer overflow”. Overflows are oftentimes the cause for security breaches. The following examples demonstrate which unexpected and devastating consequences different kinds of overflows can provoke.

## Only a few overflows made it into the history books. We have picked the most blatant three for you:

The epitome of a software bug of this kind is probably best demonstrated by the Ariane 5 rocket launch. On 4 June 1996, the unmanned rocket of the European Space Agency (ESA) was set off into orbit. On board were four highly complex satellites which should be brought into the sphere. However, after only 39 seconds the flight ended in a disaster: the rocket disintegrated into a ball of fire and smoke. Investigations have shown that the crash was not a mechanical failure. The main cause was a software bug that could have been easily detected by static analyses and unit tests.

The Ariane 5 was equipped by ESA with the identical software of the previous rocket model, the Ariane 4. The new space launcher reached a much higher velocity than the previous model. The system initiated a self-destruct sequence on exceeding a certain limit. Strictly speaking, the sideways speed was exceeded in this case. The resulting damage amounted to $ 500 million.

Another famous example of how a trivial “integer overflow” not only threatens the existence of a company but also put people’s life at risk is demonstrated by Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. A bug crept into the plane’s software, which caused the control unit to switch to a fail-safe mode after 248 days of continuous operation. If this error occurs during a flight, the pilot loses control of the aircraft and a crash is the inevitable consequence. However, if you look at the figure more closely, 248 days in hundredths of a second are exactly 2,147,483,647. To solve this significant problem, Boeing had 2 solutions: Either restarting the control unit before the 248 days expired or, the much safer option, adequate software testing.

Probably the most famous overflow bug in history is the publicly hyped Millennium Bug, Y2K. The problem of the 2000s caused headaches for lots of developers: not all applications were designed to store years after 1999. Myriads of companies had to update their software solutions to avoid possible outages. However, at the turn of the new millennium serious consequences did not occur thanks to countless hours of hardworking programmers.

Although, twelve years later an amusing incident did happen: a 105 year old Swedish lady received an invitation to start preschool. Invitations were sent throughout the Swedish kingdom to children who had the final digits “07” in their year of birth. Developers did not consider that there were individuals born in 1907.

## Automatic overflow detection

Overflows are one of the most common weaknesses of software applications. During the development of software, usually special attention is paid to avoid such problems. However, such care is neither efficient nor successful, as our selected examples demonstrate. This is true even for software projects in industries with high quality requirements.

Even simple programs often consist of several 100,000 lines of code. It is almost impossible to find every single problem in any program, let alone test such programs. The higher the complexity of an application, the more susceptible it is to software bugs. For exactly these reasons we have developed Symflower. Symflower generates unit tests fully automatically and finds potential overflows in every source code. Regardless of the number of lines of code and the complexity of the application. Even without any human influence.","Why is 12 + 7 = 3?

The results.  Conjunctions aren't that rare, in general.  There were 56 visible among 7 other planets plus the Moon and Pluto in 2020 alone.  Dec 21 2020 is the 18th closest conjunction of the 430 found across 6000 years.

It loops through all combinations of those 9  measuring apparent separation daily.  Local minima are found via SciPy's argrelextrema.  The script then recurses on each of the minima refining the timestamp of the closest approach down to the minute level by considering the 24 hours before and after the point found at day resolution.

Results are stored in Pandas DataFrames for ease of filtering, sorting and assembly from results delivered by threaded recursion.  Julian dates are used throughout because the only thing that hates prehistoric dates more datetime, is numpy.  Julian dates (float representing days, with hours, minutes, etc represented as decimal versions of a day)

Performance was an interesting challenge here.  The JPL Spice kernel file I'm using covers 3000 BCE to 3000 AD.  That's nearly 2.9 million days.  Some pairs only produce a few hundred days that need to be refined to  minute resolution others (usually involving the Moon) have 60-70k days to consider.

Those recursive calls are made to a pool of threads handled by concurrent.futures, specifically ProcessPoolExecutor.  The max number of threads in the pool is controllable.  On my MacBook plus, it finished in about 4 hours with a pool size set to 50.  I spun up a 32 CPU Ubuntu cloud box, set the pool to 500 and it was done in under an hour (total cost $0.45).

Code is here, including a 56Mb Excel file with tabs for each combination of planets, moon, Pluto.  I learned a lot about thread pools.  Without them, this script would take at least 25 times longer to run.

I have been learning Flask recently and already built some cool apps using it, but now I wanted to take it a step forward and build an app with a decent structure, meaningful docstring, and interesting (IMO) functionality. 

So, the app is a URL shortener. Yeah, I know, it is simple and not very interesting and every Flask beginner will do it at some point. So I wanted to challenge myself and build an API for it which will be used only with an access token that the user will be given only once verifying his account to prevent abuse. 

The URL shortening flow: 

When submitting a URL, it goes through a validity check and added http:// prefix in case it was not provided. Once done, a random base64 string is generated and added to an SQLite database with the submitted corresponding URL. The user is then given a short URL formatted like so: WEBSITE\_DOMAIN/token, the token is the base 64 string.  
Whenever this unique URL is visited, the user will get redirected automatically to the corresponding URL in the database.

The authorization token flow:

To generate an Authorization token, the user must verify his/her email. Once submitting, the email goes through a simple validity check, and then the database is queried to check if the email already exists in the database. If the email exists in the database and it is already verified, the user will be redirected to the ""your API token"" page. In case the email exists in the database but is not verified, the user will be redirected to the code verification page to enter the code that was previously sent to his email. If the email does not exist in the database, the user will be given a verification code to his email and will be redirected to the code verification page in order to enter the verification code and activate his email to receive an API token.

Source code: [https://github.com/PizzaMyHeart/muler](https://github.com/PizzaMyHeart/muler)

I got the idea for this app not long after starting the MIT series on YouTube. I'm still very much a programming novice (as you'll quickly gather from my code) and hit a really steep learning curve when I tried to convert this from a CLI app to a web app. Somehow managed to wrangle it into a working prototype, but I'm neck-deep in technical debt.

I know the bare minimum about classes but not enough to use them, and I'm pretty certain they will simplify my code exponentially. My plan now is to go through the rest of the MIT videos properly and try to experiment with OOP.

Installed this, threaded that, threaded the next function right next to it that was running a cholesky decomp, and like magic they both didn't stop streaming or lock!

1005,kbwn0o,Python,pybluemonday: Fast HTML Sanitization,"Sometimes in projects that have user generated content, you allow users to upload Markdown or HTML. This can be risky if you don't sanitize that content for malicious things like JavaScript. 

While I was tackling this I found a few solutions like [bleach](https://github.com/mozilla/bleach), [html_sanitizer](https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer/), and [lxml's Cleaner](https://lxml.de/api/lxml.html.clean.Cleaner-class.html). These libraries all work but I found that their performance on complicated HTML snippets were lacking because they needed to rely on [html5lib](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python) for parsing HTML5. And completely normal content would get mangled without using html5lib.

After struggling with some other ideas, I ended up creating Python bindings around the [bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday) library: https://github.com/ColdHeat/pybluemonday

By letting Go do the hard parsing and sanitization work, the performance gains are significant. 

```

```

Graph: https://github.com/ColdHeat/pybluemonday/raw/master/benchmarks.png

This library is still experimental but it passes some tests (likely more of them) from bluemonday and html_sanitizer.

1054,kbhevw,Python,Become a coder for my ideas?,"Dear fellow coders &amp; entrepreneurs;

I am an attorney in the US.

I am hard a core entrepreneur. I executed many ideas, raised money 2 times for my 2 start ups. What I found out it is very hard to find a good developer and be in a continious relationship with him/her.

My solution: I become a developer by attending bootcamp for 6 month. Yes, I can work like 15 hours a day with full attention, kind of a gift. I also have a huge interest in coding. 

After I become knowledgable about coding: 
I code my ideas without losing time, trying to find a good developer and/or find good talents for coding.

Do you think it is crazy and why would I not do this? 

PS: I am 29.

This listens on a Pub/Sub topic that's fed by another Function (bin\_reminder) that pulls in the ical data from the councils website, so I know which bin and what day also on public holidays..  

I am particularly pleased that I have built a fully automated pipeline for it and Its also got completed test cases.  I need to build more test cases, and I've been learning to make my functions smaller and more testable, so its been my first real start to finish project in python and google cloud. 

The bin reminder is going to get re-written soon with what I've learned on the text alert process.  To give it full documentation, test cases, automated pipeline etc... 

Anyhow I thought I would share it incase anyone is interested...  I hope its useful to someone..  I'm also sure there may be things that could be done better.",1

1179,kajfgq,Python,I compiled 20 code snippets to clean and tokenize text with Python,"Hi everyone,

I compiled a few code snippets to clean and tokenize text data using Python. It's especially useful when you're pre-processing data for NLP tasks.

Take a look at them below. Code highlighting doesn't work in reddit, so if you want a better reading experience check the version in [my blog](https://dylancastillo.co/nlp-snippets-clean-and-tokenize-text-with-python/).

## How to use the snippets

I'd recommend you to combine the snippets you need into a function. Then, you can use that function for pre-processing or tokenizing text. If you're using **pandas** you can apply that function to a specific column using the `.map` method of pandas' `Series`.

Here's an example:

    import re
    import pandas as pd
    
    from string import punctuation
    
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        ""text_col"": [
            ""This TEXT needs \t\t\tsome cleaning!!!..."", 
            ""This text too!!...       "", 
            ""Yes, you got it right!\n This one too\n""
        ]
    })
    
    def preprocess_text(text):
        text = text.lower()  # Lowercase text
        text = re.sub(f""[{re.escape(punctuation)}]"", """", text)  # Remove punctuation
        text = "" "".join(text.split())  # Remove extra spaces, tabs, and new lines
        return text
    
    df[""text_col""].map(preprocess_string)

Also, before testing the snippets, make sure to copy the following function at the top of your Python script or Jupyter notebook.

    def print_text(sample, clean):
        print(f""Before: {sample}"")
        print(f""After: {clean}"")

# Lowercase text

    sample_text = ""THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS WON'T: ßßß""
    clean_text = sample_text.lower()
    print_text(sample_text, clean_text)
    
    # ----- Expected output -----
    # Before: THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS WON'T: ßßß
    # After: this text will be lowercased. this won't: ßßß

## Remove cases (useful for caseles matching)

    sample_text = ""THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS too: ßßß""
    clean_text = sample_text.casefold()
    print_text(sample_text, clean_text)

        def innerFunction2(val):

You would call it like this:

    use_it()
    set_it(False)
    use_it()
    set_it(True)
    use_it()","Function Attribute vs. Nonlocal Variable with Inner Functions Does anyone have any insight or opinion on which of the below constructs is better? Or if they are essentially the same, which would be considered to be more idiomatic Python?  (And yes, I know this can be done using a class as well)

**Nonlocal Variable:**

    def outerFunction():
        test = True
    
        def innerFunction1():
            print(test)
    
        def innerFunction2(val):
            nonlocal test
            test = val
    
        return innerFunction1, innerFunction2

**Function Attribute**

    def outerFunction():
        outerFunction.test = True
    
        def innerFunction1():
            print(outerFunction.test)
    
        def innerFunction2(val):
            outerFunction.test = val
    
        return innerFunction1, innerFunction2

You would call it like this:

    use_it, set_it = outerFunction()
    use_it()
    set_it(False)
    use_it()
    set_it(True)
    use_it()",1

Python is an awesome language, you can build a decent desktop app with just the standard library. How is it possible ? Well, because Python comes with [batteries included](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#id3). So I started with a framework that relies exclusively on the standard library to create desktop applications. I ran into difficulties but kept moving forward. For example the default GUI Toolkit of Python, Tkinter does not have a built-in [Table](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9348264/does-tkinter-have-a-table-widget). That does not prevent people from creating tables, but it isn't always an obvious path for beginners who are quickly redirected to Qt by example. I created a Table widget (megawidget to be precise) to solve this issue. Then the problem of the [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/djn7f6/why_python_gui_are_so_f_ugly/) arose. I created a theme/style system to help make the GUI looks pretty. Then I ran into the problem of multithreading with Tkinter. I wrote a software library to make things easy. I continued to solve problems like this. At the beginning it only concerned the GUI, then multithreading, then the connection with the database, the interaction with JSON files, fetching resources, etc. I decided to create a graphical SQL editor using the framework to see how well it does the job. Then, I built a graphical test runner that extensively uses pyrustic.threadium (the library to facilitate multithreading). Then I wondered how to call a framework that comes with a test runner and an SQL editor. `Framework with batteries included` ? Why not software suite ? Too pretentious ? Okay, let's add ""lightweight"" and also let's add other applications to the suite to earn the title of software suite (lightweight of course). I added the Manager which helps you to manage the project you want to develop with the software suite. Then I added `Hub`. An application to publish your release package on Github. Finally, Pyrustic supports you from the start of your project, through editing/viewing the content of the database, tests running, packaging, then publishing your packaged project on Github. I also created Geet which makes the download-unpack-install-run process easier. The ReadMe on Github says more and there is also a demo video that shows the creation of a project until it is published on Github. Pyrustic and Geet are available on PyPI, so you can install them with `pip`. But beware, all versions below 1.0.0 will be considered Beta. So I'm currently targeting an audience of early adopters. I look forward to reading your feedback. And yes, I'm not an English native speaker, instead ... I SPEAK PYTHON 3.X !!!

The script will take text as an argument or from a pipe (for example from `fortune`), plus optional arguments, and will output it in a sign with an ASCII cat holding on it.  

You can set the position of the cat along the sign by specifying a percentage (0-1) via the argument `-cp` . The cat will stop at the end or beginning of the sign if the value is too high or too low.  

You can also set the horizontal position of the entire output relative to the terminal, as a percentage like before, with the argument `-gp`. The script will calculate if the drawing would be cut by the boundaries of the terminal and will adjust its position accordingly.

I made this script as an evolution of my previous project [bash-cat-with-cat](https://github.com/GuidoFe/bash-cat-with-cat), but this time I used python instead of bash. I changed language because:

1. Bash is extremely unreadable and complex compared to python
2. Python 3 has a great and intuitive support for Unicode characters
3. I loved how easy it is to manipulate and create strings, especially the possibility to multiply a string n times.
4. It was very easy to parse the arguments with the library `argparse`, although I'm not very satisfied with the auto generated help message","I made a highly customizable cowsay, but with a cat [Preview](https://github.com/GuidoFe/fortune-cat/blob/main/screen2.png).

\- Github Link [Github homepage](https://github.com/con-dog/sillynium)

**TLDW:**

\## What it does ##

sillynium lets you draw boxes directly to a webpage, around webpage elements you want, and automatically gets the elements properties for you. Different colour boxes tell the program you want to do different things. Red means ""Input text here""; Green means ""Click this button"". 

Once a drawing is finished the program generates a python selenium script, that when run, does what you told it to do. No coding required. This is an open-source alternative to browser recorders, there's no stop/start and no slowly typing text, and you can also grab any element on the page, not just elements you interact with (like in recorders). 

\- V1 was just a concept idea that draws on a \*\*\*webpage screenshot\*\*\*,

\- V2 is in development. It draws \*\*\*directly to the webpage\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\## Open-source baby! ##

It's very early days, I've tried to be extremely thorough with my GitHub repo, and have highlighted TODOs!

This is a brand new open-source initiative that I'm inviting the wider coding community to join me on. Lets get this off the ground together! Still have quite alot to do :)

(Full-time student) So I bought the “Automate the boring stuff” book and I’m going through that. Well, one of the first programs that it asked me to make was a guessing game. It took me through the entire process of how to do it. And strangely enough I actually understood every bit of it. Anyways, fast forward to a day later and I know exactly how it works (without having to reference anything) and I was able to create it with ease.

Ik creating a guessing game is a rather simple thing but I’m really proud of myself because I worked hard this semester and it obviously paid off. 

Question:
Also now I’m feeling brave and want to “create”more programs. Is there a good book you guys might suggest?

a row m1:p1:start:2.984 means, machine m1 starts process p1 at timestamp 2.984.

Goal:

Design a table schema for this data to be used by data scientist to query metrics such as process with max average elapsed time and they can plot each process. Design a ETL in python to load data to above data model /table. Follow-up

How to optimize process to parse the file and load to table. Can it be done with constant memory. There can be multiple machine m0..mN, each machine can have millions of process entries. How you will scale.

**My approach:** Python to convert the input format to dictionary {(m:p):\[start, end\]} that can be loaded to sql tables

python code :

    def calculateAvg(records):      
        d= {}      
        for record in records:         
            m, p, status, time = record.split()         
            if (m,p) in d.keys() and status == 'start':            
                d[(m,p)][0] += float(time)

Wanted to share a small python project that I thought some others might find useful. 

This project stemmed from two issues:   
1) NordVPN's endless wall of configs  
2) Most people I've met who use both NordVPN and OpenVPN download a couple configs and then always connect to the same servers using the same protocol. 

This script will scrape NordVPN’s openVPN configs (all, a specified country, and/or double-VPNs) from NordVPNs website. Then you can connect to an entirely random server, a random server from a  specified country, or a random server from a specified country pair (for double-VPNs).

Other options include specifying TCP/UDP configs when downloading/connecting, backup configs, and changing the color scheme.

I’m open to any feedback and suggestions!

Twitter Profile:  [https://twitter.com/Iamabot20385630](https://twitter.com/Iamabot20385630)

I wrote a selenium script that gets data from this site ([LINK](https://public.tableau.com/profile/doh.covid#!/vizhome/COVID-19CasesandDeathsinthePhilippines_15866705872710/Home)). Then used screenshot function and edited using the PIL module so that it would be clear enough for the Pytesseract module to easily recognize the lines of text in the screenshot. I then used the Tweepy API to tweet the results. I then used Windows Task Scheduler to run it every 8am.

Reason for choosing selenium: getting the data in pure HTML using requests module does not work, from what I researched this site uses dynamic JS (which I still do not fully comprehend)

Hello! Im a self taught python programmer and picked it up 6 months ago. I am a non IT/CS degree which proved to be difficult because starting off there were a lot of technical jargon which I had to google. I have been reading books and going through courses and multiple videos in YouTube. This is my first big project integrating API's, learning version control with Git and GitHub and using virtual environments to contain my projects. 

I have been a long lurker in this sub and all the resources posted and projects, I was inspired to do a COVID 19 bot myself but only for my city. The ***difference*** and difficulty started when I could not find an API to just GET a request. My source website had a dynamic JS code (tableau dashboard) which for weeks stumped me on how to get data from HTML. After asking questions from this sub (for which I am truly thankful) I settled for selenium automation (which for me is not ideal but it works). To the people of this sub thank you. 

Posting it here because I am happy with my improvements and things I learned (git is still a headache with the rebase and all that) and also to receive comments and suggestions on how to further my code and skills. 

What I think needs improvement:

1. I want this to run on a server (example: Heroku) so that I don't have to turn on my computer everyday
2. My code structure or how I did things, any suggestions would truly be helpful
3. I wanted to scrape the data directly where I don't have to rely on selenium because I think there's a big chance it will fail most of the time if I don't pay attention

# How to make my life easier with it?

FileGO can be useful in various ways, one way is using it with Downloads folder.

For example if I would like .mp4 files in my Downloads folder to go to my Videos folder, I could can set FileGO running in the background and let it watch the Downloads folder, so it automatically moves .mp4 files to Videos folder whenever a new one appears.

This project is made with mainly the tkinter, watchdog, and pystray libraries. 

Disclaimer: FileGO is made by a highschool student, so there might be some undiscovered flaws.

FileGO is a system tray application that automatically moves desired files from one folder to another. You can set the **path to the folder you would like FileGO to keep an eye on**, as well as **the path to the folder you would like files to be moved to**, and the **suffixes of the files that you want to move**.

# How to make my life easier with it?

FileGO can be useful in various ways, one way is using it with Downloads folder.

For example if I would like .mp4 files in my Downloads folder to go to my Videos folder, I could can set FileGO running in the background and let it watch the Downloads folder, so it automatically moves .mp4 files to Videos folder whenever a new one appears.

Turns out the package is a 6000-line single-file beast. This got me thinking, if there would be a way to neatly visualise a script's structure and inner dependencies. My initial thought was that maybe I could find some groups of definitions in Black or other files, that could be easy to refactor into sub-modules, bringing the complexity down. The graphs could also reveal some bad design if they are too interconnected.

Enter [Pyfactor](https://github.com/felix-hilden/pyfactor) (work in progress), a fresh library of mine for exactly that purpose. Parsing Python [syntax trees](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) proved easier than I thought, and I'm here to share the first fruit. Starting from simple examples, two ridiculously overcomplicated hello world applications can be found in the GitHub [readme](https://github.com/felix-hilden/pyfactor#examples) with code. Then moving on to some actual projects. The first other single-file project I could find was [sphinx-autodoc-typehints](https://github.com/agronholm/sphinx-autodoc-typehints), which generated a graph like this:

We can clearly see a central function and a hierarchy of other structures. The graph can be made clearer by removing imports from the picture.

*Processing img zkk082j3au361...*

We can observe tightly separated trees under ""format annotation"" and ""get all type hints"", and a central logger instance, referred to by many other functions. For a first-time reader this is very insightful, at least it was for me. Compared to reading 400+ loc thouroughly, from this picture alone one can get a rough understanding of what's happening. Of course it's also thanks to great naming in the library.

Now onto Black, which was a different beast. Visualising with imports was a no-go. There's too much even without them. See for yourself.

*Processing img ipg2ms9yau361...*

I'm not here to diss Black or its contributors. I think 6000 lines does it regardless. There is some obvious structure, like caching functionality on the far right, and hub variables like ""LN"", ""syms"" and ""token"", and a hub class ""Mode"". But it's rather difficult to see exactly what's going on.

More importantly, I've already found some use for this when going through some scripts and seeing what could be extracted into submodules.

I have just finished up with a little project I have been working on. As some of you might know, Google does not provide an API for it's Google Voice service. I was working on a project and looked into Text Message / SMS verification services, and they all cost money. 

I thought why not write code that uses Google Voice.

Regular servicing will keep your vehicle more reliable, reducing the chance of breakdowns, inconvenience and unnecessary expenses. In general, there are two types of service you need to perform:

a. a minor service every 6000 miles

b. a major service every 12000 miles

**Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the miles traveled, and then calculates and displays how many miles are left until the next service, as well as the type of the next service.**

Python built-in `mock` module is an awesome and battle-tested tool. It's a first choice if you want to mock something in your tests. However it has a few disadvantages:

- it doesn't work well with modern IDEs (e.g. auto completion) and type checkers
- it's difficult to define different behaviours for different cases
- it sometimes allows too much, you can do anything with your `mock` object, even if you didn't define any behaviour

Because I'm a heavy user of both - type hints and mocks - I've created `mimid`. Please let me know what do you think about this approach, about the proposed API, do you have any other problems with built-in `mock` which I can solve, etc. Any feedback would be appreciated!

1483,k8jce5,Python,Speed display of grid-based graphics by off-loading the drawing to the graphics card,"[This version of Conway’s Game of Life](https://arcade.academy/examples/conway_alpha.html) speeds everything up by using controlling a cell’s visibility through its alpha value, and handing the drawing logic off to the graphics card. 

We do NOT redraw the screen every frame. Grid-based games can take a while to render if the program uses classic raster-based graphics. Every cell has to be re-drawn every single frame. If the cells are complex at all, that adds to the rendering time.

In this program, we create all cells in the grid to begin with. After the sprites are created, we turn the cells on and off by their alpha value. We can update the entire grid by simply sending a list of alpha values to the graphics card. This significantly improves drawing time because we've reduced the amount of data sent to the graphics card to just one number per grid location.

The [Arcade library](https://arcade.academy) takes care of all the OpenGL code required for the optimization.

This is still less efficient than writing a GPU shader to do the calculations, but for people not wanting to write shaders, this code is still very simple and still has great performance.","Speed display of grid-based graphics by off-loading the drawing to the graphics card [This version of Conway’s Game of Life](https://arcade.academy/examples/conway_alpha.html) speeds everything up by using controlling a cell’s visibility through its alpha value, and handing the drawing logic off to the graphics card.

I was watching old episodes of the Graham Norton show and I found an episode with John cleese in it so I thought . YES I need to watch that. The episode had Taylor swift in it and I was a bit on the edge about her, watching the episode it seemed like John and Taylor played off each other ( Taylor was probably a bit nervous). So I ventured into the comment section. It was a war in there. One side claiming that Taylor has no sense of humour (that I didn't believe) and the other calling John a unfunny old man. So I did some research and looked online, most of the articles were that John ""dissed"" Taylor's cat and that was it but I found a interview were John cleese mentions Taylor and he was extremely complemently.
""I didn’t know her name. I heard she was from Nashville and was a country-western singer. I thought this could be hard work, and suddenly I found myself sitting next to this extraordinary, extremely smart and funny woman. I told her at the end, ‘You really ought to do comedy.’”
That is a massive complement from John. Maybe I need to do some more research on Taylor but she seemed fairly funny and got along with John.

What do you guys think about this?

And now for something completely different, that you’ll get indeed

The six of them are amazing; they’ll the best you’ll ever see   
Although one’s dead (after Terry Jones’ death: “Although two are dead…”)  
Who cares about that?   
They are timeless, timeless legends

Their humor is so hilarious that you will not resist   
And that’s certainly saying something if you’re a hypnotist  
Prepare yourself for the funniest comedy group around

There’s an inquisition, a parrot that’s deceased   
Their walks are silly-- too much, to say the least   
It’s safe to say in almost every way   
They’ve spawned a whole new age of comedy for all the generations   
They’ve a cheese shop without any cheese   
And an AL-BA-TROSS is flying in the breeze   
With old ladies, bananas, and some trees   
They were the best in all of comedy

Lumberjack who likes to wear high heels   
A lethal joke, and “how not to…” film reels   
It’s safe to say that even to this day   
They’ve been the biggest influence in all of comedy   
They had a   
Crunchy frog and a twit of upper-class

We know in the Bed sketch Graham plays Mr. Lambert who says figures 3 times too small and Eric plays Mr. Verity, who says figures 10 times too large. 

However, if Lambert really says things 3 times too small, when he says every figure Verity says is 10 times too high, he actually means Verity's figures are 30 times too high. But consequently when Verity says you need to multiply everything Lambert says by 3, you should in fact multiply by 0.1 ...

So obviously 10 and 1/3 aren't the real factors. Then how large was the bed, really?

Assume the real scaling factor for Verity and Lambert are x and 1/y (which means you need to divide everything Verity says by x and multiple everything Lambert says by y), from Lambert's comment we know 1/y \* x = 10, and from Verity's comment we know x \* y = 3. This gives us y=sqrt(0.3) \~ 0.55; x = 10sqrt(0.3) \~ 5.5. Therefore, every figure Lambert and Verity says is \~1.8 times and \~5.5 times too high, respectively.

In conclusion, the bed in question was actually 10.9ft wide, 3.6ft long and cost 145.5 pounds.","Math bug in the Bed sketch: What's the real size of the bed? &amp;#x200B;

Given the sad news of his passing, I thought people may be interested in some original pictures of Terry Jones. I'm sharing with you a Google Photos album of a selection of pictures I took in the O2 arena live show on July 2nd, 2014 (and the Q&amp;A at the end of it): [https://photos.app.goo.gl/CbPzLdsCeN4MR5rn7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CbPzLdsCeN4MR5rn7) Terry was probably experiencing some early symptoms of his illness already. He had trouble remembering lines (e.g. in the Crunchy Frog sketch, so he had it all written in a card) and his physical coordination was lacking a bit. If you pay attention to the picture of the Four Yorkshiremen sketch you can see that somehow he had cut himself so his right hand was bleeding. I think that this is what he is busy caring for when they are posing for the pictures during the Q&amp;A.

Terry was kind to notice that I was frantically raising my hand during the Q&amp;A so I could ask a question! During that session he was the nicest Python. He even took the mobile phone of a member of the public to take a crazy selfie picture. I'm very happy and grateful for the opportunity to see him live that night.","Some pictures of Terry Jones I took during one of the live 2014 shows. &amp;#x200B;
